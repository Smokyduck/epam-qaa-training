Drifting alone, upon the Dragon ship
Eerily still, no winds that tear or whip
Silence deafens, the sea is mirror calm
Blood runs like the water from my palm

I'm standing by myself
Abiding
Just me and no one else
No hiding

Horizon crumbles under flaming skies
A shadow screams from thunderclouds up high
Nidh√∂gg comes in winds of burning flames
Cast down, war and endless pain
